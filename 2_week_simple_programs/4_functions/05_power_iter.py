"""
Write an iterative function `iterPower(base, exp)` that calculates the exponential base^exp by simply using successive multiplication. For example, `iterPower(base, exp)` should compute base^exp by multiplying `base` times itself `exp` times. Write such a function below.

This function should take in two values - `base` can be a float or an integer; `exp` will be an integer â‰¥ 0. It should return one numerical value. Your code must be iterative - use of the ** operator is not allowed.
